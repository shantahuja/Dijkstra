C:\Users\shant\Desktop\Dijkstra\Dijkstra

This will take a text file with locations, routes, and the length of those routes combined (in miles) to create a dijkstra graph, which then you can enter in two locations (nodes) and find the shortest route between those two locations.

Select from following locations: Klamath Falls, Keno, Ashland, Medford, Chemult, Bend, Sisters, Eugene, Oakridge, Glide, Roseburg, Medford, Grants Pass, Crescent City, Brookings, Winston, Coquille, Gold Beach, Port Orford, Bandon, Coos Bay, Lakeside, Reedsport, Sutherlin, Elkton, Drain, Florence

Be sure to go into main.cpp and change the filepath to c:\the file for the dijkstra folder here\Dijkstra\Dijkstra\Lab_04.txt
